# Kinesin-Simulation
Basic Simulation of Kinesin molecules along axon using cellular automata
The code is based on Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion(TASEP), coupled with Langmuir Kinetics. This is the first version wherein only unidirectional transport has been considered. Currently working on the bidirectional case.
